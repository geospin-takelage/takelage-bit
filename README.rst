============

bit_ is a git_ extension. bit is not meant to replace git.
You may think of bit as a git powered clipboard manager
with versioning and central storage.
This project is the central storage.

Both bit and git are in their core free and open source tools.
Around these tools both free and non-free infrastructure has emerged.
git sparked projects like GitHub_ and GitLab_ while bit has been
developed by the company behind `bit.dev`_.

bit.dev's intended audience is the javascript community and
they also host the the best resource on bit: the `bit docs`_.
